Quiz Creator
A simple command-line tool I built to create and manage multiple-choice quiz questions.

What it does? - This tool lets you create multiple-choice questions, save them to a file, and manage your question bank. I built it with a colorful interface to make it more engaging to use.

Features:
Create multiple-choice questions with 4 options
Save questions automatically to a file
Load your previously created questions when you restart
Reset all questions if you want to start fresh
Nice colorful interface with emojis for better user experience
