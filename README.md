Quiz Creator
A simple command-line tool I built to create and manage multiple-choice quiz questions.

What it does? - This tool lets you create multiple-choice questions, save them to a file, and manage your question bank. I built it with a colorful interface to make it more engaging to use.

Features:

1. Create multiple-choice questions with 4 options

2. Save questions automatically to a file

3. Load your previously created questions when you restart

4. Reset all questions if you want to start fresh

5. Nice colorful interface with emojis for better user experience
