# Tkinter Quiz App  
A simple GUI-based quiz application I built using Python's Tkinter module.

## What it does  
This app reads multiple-choice quiz questions from a text file and presents them to the user in a friendly, interactive graphical interface. It displays one question at a time, checks answers, updates the score, and shows results at the end. Great for reviewing or testing knowledge!

## Features

- Loads questions from a `.txt` file in JSON format  
- Displays one multiple-choice question at a time with 4 options  
- Checks if the selected answer is correct and updates the score  
- Automatically moves to the next question after submitting  
- Ends the quiz and shows final score once all questions are answered  
- Shows the correct answer in red if the user's answer is wrong  
- Exit button with confirmation popup  
- Clean and colorful GUI layout for a smooth user experience

To run the app, make sure you have a valid `quiz_questions.txt` file in the same directory, containing properly formatted JSON questions.

This app is perfect for simple quizzes, practice tests, or just for fun!
