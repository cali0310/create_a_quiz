Quiz Creator
A simple command-line tool I built to create and manage multiple-choice quiz questions.

What it does? - This tool lets you create multiple-choice questions, save them to a file, and manage your question bank. I built it with a colorful interface to make it more engaging to use.

Features:
\nCreate multiple-choice questions with 4 options
\nSave questions automatically to a file
\nLoad your previously created questions when you restart
\nReset all questions if you want to start fresh
\nNice colorful interface with emojis for better user experience
